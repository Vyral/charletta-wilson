Do you know what’s scarier than ghosts, goblins, and ghouls? No, not 2020—perfectionism.&nbsp;

Now more than ever, we’re afraid of people and their judgment. **Perfectionism is just that: a socially prescribed disposition where anything less than perfect is unacceptable.** The behavior of perfectionism stems from our fear of failure, embarrassment, and shame. It’s more than a habit; it’s a mindset. And you know what? It wears you out.&nbsp;

I tangoed with perfectionism for a very long time, but I also worked at it equally as long. It’s a hard truth, but I’m not ashamed of it because it’s a pervasive issue for leaders, particularly those who’ve grown up under strict care and leadership, have had micromanaging bosses, or perhaps have had traumatic experiences resulting in deep scars.&nbsp;

It’s important to know that perfectionism isn’t a disease, but it is exhausting and costly. For example, in my last video blog, you saw a two-and-a-half-minute, relatively polished product. However, at the 1:30 mark in the video above, you can see that the making of that product was messy. It’s a struggle for me because I want to nail it the first time. I will say, though, that my technical producers love me for this.&nbsp;

Some other indicators of perfectionism include all-or-nothing thinking, defensiveness when receiving feedback, rewriting emails over and over again, procrastinating, or becoming disappointed when things turn out less than perfect.&nbsp;

Now that we know what perfectionism looks like, it’s not all gloom and doom. If this speaks to you, there is hope. Three words have changed my perspective and habits around perfectionism: **grace, emergence, and acceptance.** When put to practice, each of these words can snuff the spooky out of perfectionism.&nbsp;

If you’d like to explore this concept a little deeper in a safe, nonjudgemental space, contact me. I’d be happy to speak with you. Until next *time, aloha* and *salamat po*\!
