Aloha\! I hope this message finds you and your family healthy and safe.

Leadership is not a destination, it’s a journey. For that reason, I believe **all leaders need a coach and coaching skills.** Coaching is an excellent way for leaders to go deeper and explore their inner capacities.&nbsp;

Lately, I’ve been coaching some common themes, and one of them is the inner dialogue. I truly believe that our inner dialogue can get us into a lot of trouble and cause us to miscommunicate. You need to think about the assumptions you have when beginning conversations. I won’t mention the familiar adage about assumptions, but you likely know what I mean. When you identify an assumption you’re making, ask yourself what information you still need. Why did your mind decide it needed that presumption?&nbsp;

If you’re in decision-making mode and find you’re thinking about worst-case scenarios with negative outcomes, listen for this in your thoughts. Disrupt these thoughts with a question: Yes, these are things that could occur, but **what are the opportunities that could happen?** It’s all about mindset; move from a fixed to a growth mindset.&nbsp;

We all have an inner critic, and some call them their saboteur or enemy. I named mine, and call her Mellie. Whatever you call it, recognize that the inner voice that tries to keep us small is just trying to protect us.

What I love about coaching is that I get to help leaders grow in their awareness and capacity to put these things in check, and provide them with tools and practices to apply when tensions are high. **As leaders grow into their skills to be coached, they also grow in their skills to coach others.**&nbsp;

If you have questions or would like to learn more about how you can become a great leader through coaching, contact me via phone or email me at info@capeeshconsulting.com. I would love to help you. Aloha\!
