Are you a senior leader of an organization or team and want something different for 2023? We’re nearing the end of the year, and it's time to start looking at how we want to approach 2023. One suggestion I have is to take a close look at your learning and development strategy. Quite often, we start with the strategic stuff because we want to reevaluate our vision and our mission. However, I suggest that you go even deeper. Perhaps it's time to start looking at the relationship that you or your team has with these three things:

**1\. The mind.** Do you know that we have over 180 cognitive biases that we are subject to falling into every single day? I sure hope that we aren't limited to the scope of our thinking.

**2\. Time.** We often hear the saying, “I don't have enough time,” or “I ran out of time,” but how about managing time better?&nbsp;

**3\. The uncontrollable.** I think this is the most difficult relationship. The uncontrollable consists of everyday change, temptation, problems, testing, etc.&nbsp;

I strongly believe in individuals leading from authenticity. We can't stop at just how we think and behave—we also have to look at how we feel, as well as our spirit life. We are coming off the heels of a lot of heaviness, trauma, and disruption. Today we need leaders who are capable of going the distance. We are in a long-haul game and we need these skills.&nbsp;

Here's the good news: Even though you've likely already tapped into your strategic planning, it's not too late to go back and look at your learning and development, and weave that in to ensure it's tightly embedded. Our inside game strongly influences our outside game.
