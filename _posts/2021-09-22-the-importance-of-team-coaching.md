Of all the different roles I have working with organizations, my favorite is 'team coach'. In 2021, I had the amazing opportunity to do some transformative work.&nbsp;**As we approach the end of the year, here's what some leaders have to say about their deep-dive learning:&nbsp;**

*“What I learned about shame is that it’s ultimately the feeling that you’re not good enough or you’re not worthy. But the sooner you can acknowledge it and name it, you can move through it quickly and move on to the next thing.”*

*“What I’ve learned about values is that it’s something I can always fall back on, and it’s the one thing that’s going to keep me true to who I am.”*

*“What I’ve learned about boundaries is that it is okay to say ‘No,’ and I still matter.”*

*“Building courage has definitely impacted my life in a way. Nowadays, I’m not so afraid to make mistakes. I go into something giving it my best, and If I don’t come out how I expect to come out, I look at everything in a positive light, roll with the punches, and take everything I go through in a positive way.”*

*“What I learned about vulnerability is that most of us run from it because we have this fear of being ‘exposed.’ What I learned is that we will expose ourselves, but there’s a joy that comes from that when we expose everything and can be who we truly are.”*

**The reason I bring these quotes to you is—****learning does not happen in a vacuum.**&nbsp;Leaders need time to process, and the team coaching approach is a sound methodology to bring your leadership to that next level. If you want to take your leaders to the next frontier, consider team coaching.
