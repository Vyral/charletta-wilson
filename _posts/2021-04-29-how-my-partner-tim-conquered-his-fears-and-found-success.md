As a business owner, I get to talk to a lot of different people. Last week, I was inspired by the wisdom of Jim Rone, who says, “Success leaves clues.” That means if we listen closely and observe carefully, there’s guidance waiting for us to lead us to where our hearts are calling.

I’m joined today by my business partner and partner in life, Tim, to share some insight into how he transitioned from the military to starting up his own real estate practice here in the paradise of Hawaii. **I’m hoping this conversation will help you pick up some clues to use to your advantage.**

After 25 years serving our country, Tim knew he wanted something different than the military. Staying connected to that world wouldn’t afford him the opportunity.&nbsp;

Did he have fears? Of course. He feared the unknown, failure, and disappointing his family, just to name a few.&nbsp;

**The first step Tim took to find a solution was discovering what motivated him and what sent him in the direction he wanted to pursue**. One thing that was important was having autonomy and an unlimited earning potential. He found both of those things in real estate, and he’s now in his fourth year in business.

Surprises? There were many. To be successful in any business, you really have to hone in on networking skills, relationships, and team building.

The biggest lesson Tim learned was to buy-in before starting the business. Another lesson he learned is how to be OK with making mistakes. It’s so easy to make comparisons to what your peers are doing. What works for some might not work for others. Lastly, knowing your “why” will keep you grounded when things get weird.

**Tim’s final message is this: Never stop improving on effective communication.** As long as you’re serving people, communication is essential. It’s also vulnerable, liberating, and fulfilling.&nbsp;

Thanks to Tim for sharing all of his wisdom. If you’re in the market to buy, sell, or rent a home in Hawaii, I know a great Realtor and would love to either help or refer you.

If you have any additional questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
