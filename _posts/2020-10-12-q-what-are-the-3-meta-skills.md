Aloha\! today I want to challenge the traditions of what it means to be a successful leader. It’s no secret that we’re living in VUCA times (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous). In these difficult times, we’re looking for ways to not just be good leaders, but effective ones. So we look to the leadership gurus like Simon Sinek, who says to focus on our “why,” Stephen Covey says to address our “seven highly effective habits,” and Brene Brown who asserts that we should “answer our call to courage.”&nbsp;

Whichever method you choose, you need the three meta-skills. I love working with leaders to grow their meta-skills. So what are these meta-skills?

**1\. Self-awareness.** This isn’t a soft skill, it’s a power skill, and you need it to tap into the next level. This allows you to go below the surface and not only addresses the tactical things you do but also helps you connect with others.&nbsp;

**2\. Creativity.** I believe the soul of creativity is curiosity. We need to learn to ask more questions. Instead of approaching life with a ‘yes or no’ or ‘right or wrong’ mentality, ask questions like “What else do I need to learn?” This can be very powerful and open a gateway to possibilities.&nbsp;

**3\. Resilience.** Life is messy, and it’s imperfect. Things aren’t always going to go as planned. We need the ability to pick ourselves up and keep moving forward. A great place to start is with self-empathy.&nbsp;

VUCA times require us to unlearn, learn, and relearn many things. You’ve got this. We’ve got this.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about meta-skills or how to be a successful leader, reach out to us by phone or email. We would love to help you.
