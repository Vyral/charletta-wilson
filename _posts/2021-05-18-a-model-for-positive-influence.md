The winds of change are coming in fast and furious. If your organization or team is undergoing a change, we need to talk. When change is happening, two questions permeate the air: 1) How does this relate to me? and 2) Will I be relevant at the end of the change? **As leaders, we can be proactive when answering these questions, minimizing fears, and pushback.**&nbsp;

That said, Iâ€™d like to share a tool with you called the SCARF model (Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness), originated by researcher David Rock of the Neuroleadership Institute. In times of change, the SCARF model offers a way to look at our experience from the lens of empathy. **Hereâ€™s an example of the model in action:**

* **Safety:** Whenever possible, give positive feedback and publicly acknowledge the things that are going well.&nbsp;
* **Certainty:** Give clear expectations, and whatever you do, donâ€™t overpromise.
* **Autonomy:** Create as many opportunities as possible for your team members to have voice and choice.
* **Relatedness:** Create social opportunities to talk about the wins, concerns, and failures.&nbsp;
* **Fairness:** Be clear with communication, be transparent, and make sure your rules are consistent.&nbsp;

I hope this model helps you navigate the winds of change. If youâ€™d like additional tips on how to improve your SCARF factors around change management, feel free to drop me a line. Iâ€™d love to help you. *Aloha* and *Salamat Po*\!
