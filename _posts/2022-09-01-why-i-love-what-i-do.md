Aloha\! People frequently ask me why I love my work so much, and I’m here to share the answer with you. In a nutshell, **I love serving people**. I genuinely believe that our lives are not just our own. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been a listener; I enjoy hearing people’s stories, and that skill has served me well.&nbsp;

As a coach, consultant, and facilitator, the core of my work is hearing stories from individuals and teams and then helping my clients make sense of what’s truly happening. What I love most about being of service to people is helping them live a fuller life. I believe that the potential we have as humans can’t be discovered alone. **You have a partner when you work with me; I’m walking alongside you.** I love to help people dream bigger, and more importantly, I’m a great accountability partner to help you ensure you’re taking the right steps and finding the resources you need.

Let me know if you have any questions, I’d love to connect with you. Also, if you’ve worked with me before, I’d love for you to email me a note letting me know what the best part of CaPeesh Consulting was for you. *Salamat Po\!*
