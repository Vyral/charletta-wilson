Today I am speaking with Sean, my video editor and friend, about an important topic --&nbsp;**ACCOUNTABILITY**. Anyone who wants to have an impact in the world needs this.&nbsp; Sean and I have established a working relationship that helps me stretch my edge in video production.&nbsp; I'm convinced that without accountability, talents are left stifled.

The word "accountability" means different things to different people.&nbsp; But, at the heart, it's about building trust and relationships AND is an essential part of growth. Without accountability or with unclear parameters, conflict is likely to ensue.

As a&nbsp;**quick audit to your accountability relationships**, consider if you have:

* Clearly defined what accountability looks like in behavioral context&nbsp;
* Established a two-way process for checking in and feedback
* Clear parameters of your options
* Clear understanding of consequences
* Asked for help
* Expressed gratitude for the mutual support

After working with Sean for nearly two years, I've learned that effective accountability grows trust AND moves me closer to my growth goals.&nbsp; Hopefully, this conversation inspires you to revisit the power of accountability in your work and life.&nbsp; Whether you are trying to get into better health, a better role or to grow your company to another level -- consider how accountability can work to your benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have an accountability story to share or want to noodle ways to integrate better accountability in your systems, reach out. I am glad to help.

Salamat po and happy holidays\!
