Life has felt like it's been spinning out of control.&nbsp; And for this reason, I'm grateful for ALIGNMENT WEEK - a series of days where I take time off to slow down and...think.&nbsp;

**Alignment week is different from making a mid-year or a new year’s resolution.**&nbsp;The process is equally important to the outcome.&nbsp; I set an intention for deep thinking about the spiritual, mental, physical, financial, relational, and vocational aspects of life. The process begins with removing distractions and blocking out noise.&nbsp; Then, I explore what’s true for me and my family.&nbsp; Each domain of life gets a spotlight and attention.&nbsp; Afterward, I make prioritized decisions on the best way forward. I've been doing this process for years and it keeps me attuned and honest to living out my life purpose.

This is the secret sauce behind my confidence.&nbsp;**When I’m living according to what’s true to me and my family, everyone else gets the better version of me.**&nbsp;The world has a way of making chopped salad out of those who don’t take time to align. I’m curious about your process to 'get or stay' aligned to what matters most to you.

This fall, I’ll be announcing a small group coaching opportunity where I will take a group of leaders through this alignment process. If you are interested and ready to focus on life-alignment, send me an email at&nbsp;[info@capisceconsulting.com](mailto:info@capisceconsulting.com){: target="_blank"}. I’d be glad to put you on the VIP list. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
