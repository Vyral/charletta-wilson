Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to work with a group of executive leaders who lead some of the largest organizations in the state of Hawaii. It was like a fireside chat with 12 of my closest friends–except it was the first time I’d met many of them. However, within a few short minutes of our gathering, we dug right into our topic: how to set better boundaries.

To get us started, I polled the group to see who thought they were effective in setting boundaries. Consistent with other group discussions I’ve led on the topic, the majority said, “no” to effectiveness and “yes” to wanting better boundary skills. After receiving that insight, we began our work.

**Boundaries Defined**

To begin any sort of change, it’s always important to define what the group is talking about and get a common horizon. So, I asked how they defined the term *boundaries*. In popcorn fashion, we gathered many definitions including, “a line of demarcation that you don’t cross”, “something that protects you”, “scope creep”, and “areas that are off-limits”. After several minutes of brainstorming, we settled on Brene Brown’s simple, but catchy *Dare to Lead™* definition: “What’s okay and not okay”.

Check point. Notice the balance in this definition. It doesn’t just focus on one side of the street. It suggests if you go here, you are in good graces with me, but if you go there, we are on to a different tune. What I like most about this definition is that it represents the true nature of a boundary. People often picture a boundary looking like a barricade, when it’s more like a picket fence. They suggest boundaries…

• are selfish<br>• are mean or disrespectful<br>• will burn bridges, or<br>• stifle relationships.

This couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, boundaries are not about limitations, they are about options and, more importantly, fostering trust. When communicated with skill, a boundary can say, “I think enough of you and me that I will let you know what works for me and what doesn’t.” It is then up to the person to decide if they want to honor your needs or go rogue. If you remain consistent in your behavior, this translates to integrity. That’s the stuff that binds not divides.

**Barriers to Setting a Boundary**

After we clarified a working definition of *boundaries*, we then explored the barriers to setting boundaries. As you might guess, the major theme was fear…fear of hurting people, fear of being hurt by others for expressing an opposing need, fear of being judged or criticized, and fear of not being taken seriously. Those are a lot of fears\!

**7 Tips to Being a Better Boundary-Setter**

I was so inspired by this group. They shared many examples of how their attempts to set boundaries were either met with disapproval, push back, or oblivion. So, we rolled up our sleeves and identified seven considerations to boost our boundary setting effectiveness:

**1\.** Setting boundaries feels vulnerable. Lean in anyway.<br>**2\.** Remember that a boundary is a form of self-respect and self-love.<br>**3\.** Start with setting “pea-sized” boundaries, then work your way to removing the training wheels.<br>**4\.** To convey a boundary with care, speak what’s okay AND not okay so that the other person knows the full range of their options. Example, “What’s okay is for you to disagree with my perspective. What’s not okay is that you talk behind my back”.<br>**5\.** Boundaries can be conveyed as a statement. “No.”<br>**6\.** Boundaries can be conveyed as a request. “I’m limited on time, can this be done tomorrow?”<br>**7\.** Remember that a boundary not openly communicated is only a wish.

Remember, boundaries are a teachable skill that takes time and practice. You will know if you’ve missed an opportunity because guilt or frustration will have a way of knocking on your door.

Be kind to yourself and…just…keep…practicing.
