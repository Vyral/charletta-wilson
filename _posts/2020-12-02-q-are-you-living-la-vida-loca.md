Are you going stir-crazy trying to master the involuntary meld of school, work, and home? Well, me too. I’ve been working from home for the past 10 years, but I never imagined that I would also be educating my son at home at the same time. Today I’m expanding on my somewhat recent revelation: **The only way to master “la vida loca” is to become a scientist**—an investigator who observes, asks questions, and conducts experiments.&nbsp;

Initially, when COVID-19 struck and my life as I knew it flipped upside down, I clung anxiously to rituals. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with rituals; they serve an important purpose. However, in some circumstances, rituals can get you bogged down. To help me explain how I experiment with different setups to make work, school, and home life better in 2020, I’ve enlisted the help of my co-worker, lunch buddy, and walking partner: My son Noah.

1. **We anchor.** In our house, we do this through our devotion, prayer, and occasional meditation. This helps us stay grounded so we don’t slip as easily when unexpected things get thrown at us.&nbsp;
2. **We sync our calendars.** This is important because our day can get pretty messy when we don’t know how many meetings/obligations we have.&nbsp;
3. **We eat a healthy breakfast.** Fueling up for the day ahead is a step that can’t be skipped. Noah’s favorite thing to eat in the morning: waffles with cinnamon\!&nbsp;
4. **We get in some physical exercise.** We like to go on walks, play 2-square, and dance to music. Though he’ll try to deny it, Noah loves jamming out to ‘80s tunes\!&nbsp;
5. **We write each other love notes** on either Post-its or the mirror. Noah always leaves thoughtful sticky notes on my iPad.&nbsp;
6. **We aim for eight hugs a day.** These are probably my favorite part of the day. Physical touch keeps the body’s “happy” chemicals flowing.&nbsp;
7. **We connect with friends.** I always encourage Noah to connect with at least one of his friends, whether through Zoom or on the phone. We’re all social creatures at our core, so keeping our relationships nurtured is super important for our overall well-being and survival.&nbsp;

Once you get started experimenting (either with these seven daily pillars or your own), you’ll find it’s easier than you thought. Be observant, though, and constantly assess what’s working and what’s not. Ask a lot of questions of your family members, because everyone’s experience will be different. Remember: Experiment with options that serve you, not imprison you. Be sure to give yourself a bit of grace, too, because the road ahead may be a long one.&nbsp;

At 3:22 in the video above, Noah pitched the idea of running one more experiment in our household: Getting a dog. Yikes…just when I thought we had “la vida loca” under control\! **If you’re for Team Noah, smash that like button to show your support for a puppy purchase; if you’re for Team Mom, go ahead and leave me a comment below.&nbsp;**

Either way, we’d love to hear from you. As always, please feel free to reach out by phone or email if you ever have any questions or concerns that I can help you with\! *Salamat po\!*
