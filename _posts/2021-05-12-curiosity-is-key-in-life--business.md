If you’re a coaching client of mine, past or present, you’ve probably heard me mention the word ‘curiosity’ dozens, if not hundreds, of times. The reason is that curiosity is a kind of superpower that’s accessible to everyone. Management consultant Peter Drucker says that we can be “intelligently curious.”

Curiosity can be applied via strategy, innovation, and relationships. Think about it: Strategy is nothing but a best guess—without guessing, strategy wouldn’t even be strategy. We have to experiment with different combinations to see what works. Big companies like Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb all do this.

In relationships, curiosity is a must-have. I’ve been married to my husband and best friend for over 28 years; if we stopped getting curious about each other, things would get boring fast.

If you were someone who used to be curious only to have people you loved or society in general shoot your ideas down and started to admonish you for being a know-it-all, here’s an opportunity for you. A few of my friends at Keller Williams Honolulu gave me some **tips on how we can grow our curiosity:**

1. Ask questions. You have to ask questions without expecting that you already know the answer.&nbsp;
2. Don’t let the past dictate your future.&nbsp;
3. Make friends with people who aren’t like you and don’t share the same ideas.
4. Listen to others’ stories without attaching your own stories to them.

The list of tips could go on for a long time, but those are a good start for growing your curiosity again. Don’t forget to keep practicing your curiosity and courage, and permit yourself to screw up sometimes.

If you have any questions or would like further advice about fostering your curiosity, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you. *Aloha, and salamat po\!*
