How do you boost resilience within your work team?

Begin with self. Resilience is our ability to recover from setback, failure, and disruption. It’s not an event— it’s a journey, and we get to do it over and over again. Unfortunately, there’s no pill for resilience. It’s more like a group of muscles that we practice repeatedly: The more you use them, the stronger they get.&nbsp;

Here are three steps to implement in your workplace:

**1\. Acknowledge and name it.** When we acknowledge and name where we’ve fallen short or where the pain point is, we loosen the power and grip it has over our life. Naming what we’re experiencing and identifying the emotion that goes along with it will help boost recovery.&nbsp;

**2\. Give yourself permission to be human and make mistakes.** This step is tricky because, if you’re like me and grew up believing you had to be perfect (or at least look perfect on the outside), you know it’s far from reality. When I’ve had a fall and have been able to identify that it hurts, I ask myself, “What would you tell your five-year-old self if she had a similar experience?” By incorporating this practice, I’m growing my self-compassion and self-empathy.&nbsp;

**3\. Refrain from blame language.** If you get stuck in a rut, cast blame, or find fault in what happened and aren’t able to move on, you’re wasting energy. Reframe the situation from “What’s happened?” to “Where’s the opportunity?”

The more we practice, the better we get—and the stronger we are. That’s how we empower our team members.&nbsp;
