If you’re a coaching client of mine, past or present, you’ve probably heard me mention the word ‘curiosity’ dozens, if not hundreds, of times. The reason is that curiosity is a kind of superpower –that’s accessible to everyone. Management consultant, Peter Drucker, says that we should strive to be ‘intelligently curious.’

Curiosity is generative and can be applied in&nbsp;**strategy, innovation**, and&nbsp;**relationships**. Think about it: Strategy is nothing but a best guess put to action.&nbsp; We have to experiment with different combinations to see what works. We can take note of how innovation multiplies assets through examples like Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

In relationships, curiosity is a must-have. This isn’t science but I’ve been married to my husband and best friend for over 28 years; if we stopped getting curious about each other, things would get boring fast.&nbsp;

If you were someone who used to be curious only to have people you loved or society, in general, shoot your ideas down or reward you for being a ‘knower’, here’s an opportunity for you.

A few of my friends at Keller Williams Honolulu shared a few&nbsp;**tips on how we can grow our curiosity:**

1. **Ask more questions without expecting you already know the answer.&nbsp;**&nbsp;
2. **Don’t let the past dictate the future.**
3. **Make friends with people who aren’t like you or share the same ideas.**
4. **Listen to others’ stories without attaching your own stories to them.**

The list of tips are endless, but this is a good start to upskill and start seeing real benefits in business and in life.&nbsp; Don’t forget to keep practicing your curiosity and courage, and give yourself permission to screw up…and keep practicing some more\!

Send me a message and let me know how you or your team foster’s curiosity.&nbsp; I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;*Aloha, and salamat po\!*
