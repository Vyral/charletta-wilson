Are you going stir-crazy trying to master the involuntary meld of school, work, and<br>home? Well, me too. I’ve been working from home for the past 10 years, but I never imagined that I would also be educating my son at home, at the same time. Today I’m expanding on my somewhat recent revelation:&nbsp;**The only way to master “la vida loca” is to become a scientist**—an investigator who observes, asks<br>questions, and conducts experiments.&nbsp;

Initially, when COVID-19 struck and my life as I knew it flipped upside down, I clung anxiously to rituals. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with rituals; they serve an important purpose. However, in some circumstances, rituals can get you bogged down. To help me explain how I experiment with different setups to make work, school, and home life better in 2020, I’ve enlisted the help of my co-worker, lunch buddy, and walking partner: My son Noah.

**1\. We anchor.**&nbsp;In our house, we do this through our devotion, prayer, and<br>occasional meditation. This helps us stay grounded so we don’t slip as easily<br>when unexpected things get thrown at us.&nbsp;

**2\. We sync our calendars.**&nbsp;This is important because our day can get pretty<br>messy when we don’t know how many meetings/obligations we have.&nbsp;

**3\. We eat a healthy breakfast.**&nbsp;Fueling up for the day ahead is a step that can’t<br>be skipped. Noah’s favorite thing to eat in the morning: waffles with<br>cinnamon\!&nbsp;

**4\. We get in some physical exercise.**&nbsp;We like to go on walks, play 2-square,<br>and dance to music. Though he’ll try to deny it, Noah loves jamming out to<br>‘80s tunes\!&nbsp;

**5\. We write each other love notes&nbsp;**on either Post-its or the mirror. Noah<br>always leaves thoughtful sticky notes on my iPad.&nbsp;

**6\. We aim for eight hugs a day.**&nbsp;These are probably my favorite part of the<br>day. Physical touch keeps the body’s “happy” chemicals flowing.&nbsp;

**7\. We connect with friends.**&nbsp;I always encourage Noah to connect with at least<br>one of his friends, whether through Zoom or on the phone. We’re all social<br>creatures at our core, so keeping our relationships nurtured is super<br>important for our overall well-being and survival.&nbsp;<br>Once you get started with your own experimentation, you’ll find science can be<br>easy and accessible.

Be observant, though, and continuously assess what’s working and what’s not. Ask a lot of questions of your family members, because everyone’s experience will be different. Remember: Experiment with options that serve you, not imprison you. Be sure to give yourself a bit of grace, too, because the road ahead may be a long one.
