It’s February - the month we celebrate love, the Lunar New Year, and my birthday &nbsp; (yes, 25, again)\!&nbsp; Birthdays, much like the new year, are times for reflection and renewal because we’re reminded of the brevity of time.&nbsp; We look at what truly matters, and can see a little bit clearer.&nbsp;

**Here’s a secret:**&nbsp;I don’t just celebrate my birth*day*; I celebrate the entire month.&nbsp; I love celebrating all month long because it reinforces the importance of intentionally asking ‘*What do I need to feel whole*?’ &nbsp;&nbsp;

That simple question often inspires me to some type of action that I would typically ignore. For example, one year I took up ballroom dancing and black and white photography. I wasn’t so great at the latter, but it was worth a try and fed my need for creativity.&nbsp; In recent years, I started celebrating those closest to me and raising money for causes near and dear to my heart.

This year was a little different; I got a haircut and went to the dentist. Those are simple things but restorative nonetheless. In the haste of life, we need to remind ourselves of our humanness and what we love.&nbsp;**That’s the real gift—being able to come home to oneself**. When things are crazy and the circus is happening in life, I need strategies to feel grounded.&nbsp;

As a business owner, coach to many leaders, and busy mom, I hear one consistent message from everyone: “I’ve hit the pandemic wall, and I’m tired.” So here is my invitation: Let’s all pretend it’s our birthday month, and ask ourselves that crucial question:&nbsp;**What do I need to feel whole?**&nbsp;See what arises and give yourself permission to do and be.&nbsp;

It’s that simple.&nbsp;

Whether that means spending a day at the beach, hiking or walking a trail, practicing your golf swing, cleaning out your closet, or something else - just do it with no apology.&nbsp; It doesn’t have to be your birthday to acknowledge your humanness and live your values.&nbsp;**When you take care of yourself, others will follow.**

If this message resonates with you, send me an email, and let me know that you’re doing to take good care of you.&nbsp; If this is a message someone else needs to hear, please forward it to them.&nbsp;*Salamat po\!*
