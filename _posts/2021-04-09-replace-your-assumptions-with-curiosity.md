What’s the main stumbling block in the life of a senior leader? After doing hundreds upon hundreds of coaching sessions, **I believe the biggest hindrance we need to catch is the assumptions we make.** To that point, I’d like to share a quote from “The Four Agreements,” a book I highly recommend by Don Miguel Ruiz:&nbsp;

*“We make the assumption that everyone sees life the way that we do. We assume that others think the way we think, feel the way we feel, judge the way we judge, and abuse the way we abuse. This is the biggest assumption that humans make, and this is why we have a fear of being ourselves around others. Because we think everyone else will judge us, victimize us, abuse us, and blame us as we do ourselves. So even before others have a chance to reject us, we have already rejected ourselves. That is the way the human mind works.”*

**The judgments we make about ourselves, others, and our circumstances are often made in the image of our worst thoughts.** Catch those assumptions, criticisms, and judgments in the moment as often as you can. There’s no shame there—we all have judgments and assumptions, but we need to replace those with curiosity, and ask ourselves what we don’t know, what’s missing, and who we need to contact to clarify what’s happening. That’s the crux—or heartbeat if you will—of leadership and the evolution of becoming better versions of ourselves.&nbsp;
