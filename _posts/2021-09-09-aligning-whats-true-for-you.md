I’m sure you’ve also felt like life is spinning a bit out of control with the pandemic and everything else. This week is alignment week. That means this is a series of days where I take time off to slow down and make space to think.

**Alignment week is different from making a mid-year or a new year's resolution.** What I love about alignment week is that it's an intentional time to think deeply about the spiritual, mental, physical,&nbsp; financial, relational, and vocational aspects of life. During this time, I block out all the noise to think about what's true for me and my family. Then, I make prioritized decisions on the best way forward. When I take this process step by step, it keeps me attuned and honest about my purpose in life.

This is the secret sauce behind my confidence. **When I'm living according to what's true to me and my family, everyone else gets the better version of me.** The world has a way of making chopped salad out of those who don't take time to align. I'm curious about what process you go through in order to align and what matters most to you.

This fall, I'll be announcing a small group coaching opportunity where I will take a group of leaders through this alignment process. If this sounds like something interesting to you, email me at info@capisceconsulting.com. I'd be glad to put you on the VIP list. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
