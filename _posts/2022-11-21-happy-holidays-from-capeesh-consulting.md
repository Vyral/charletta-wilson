In just a few short weeks, we will be approaching the end of the calendar year, so I want to extend a special thank you to all of my client friends, colleagues, and personal circle. **Without you, we could not have reached thousands of leaders across the globe in over 40 countries.** Next year, we hope to bring fresh, new content that digs deep and brings learning to the surface.

If you've been following our work for any amount of time, you know that **love and learning are at the heart of what we do.** Life isn't perfect, work isn't perfect, and relationships aren't perfect, but that's why we do what we do.&nbsp;

We are going to take a dose of our own medicine and pause for the remainder of the year. This will be our last recording in 2022. We'll be resting, connecting with loved ones, and enjoying good food and laughter. When 2023 picks back up, we hope that you will join us with our new content. **We have some exciting things coming up that will bring us even deeper into the heart of what we do.**

If you have any questions, call or email us. In the meantime, have a happy holiday season and we'll see you again in 2023.
