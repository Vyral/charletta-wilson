Let’s dive a little deeper. When I feel vulnerable, it arises in my stomach and chest. We loathe it, we don’t want it, and we try to pretend it doesn’t exist. Some behaviors that become a byproduct of this thinking are shaming, blaming, deflection, hiding, and simply faking the funk—i.e., trying to become someone you’re not. Whatever your vice is, it’s not working. It’s counterproductive to what you really want - safety.&nbsp;

So what do you do when vulnerability strikes? You navigate\!

What if I told you there are strategies that can take the gut-punch out of this feeling? In the words of Viktor Frankl: “Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” The next time you feel vulnerable, I invite you to try one or all of these strategies to create that 'space':

**1\. Deep belly breathing.**&nbsp;Take two to three minutes and just breathe. If you notice that just your chest is rising and falling, you’re not going deep enough. Drop down deeper until your belly button is rising and falling as well. Doing a few sets of this can instantly activate the parts of our brain that create calm.&nbsp;

**2\. Compassion.**&nbsp;Find that place in your body where you feel the vulnerability. Like I mentioned earlier, I typically feel it in my gut and chest. What you would do is place your hand over that area and say to yourself, “I’m safe, this moment will pass, and I choose not to sit in fear and remain stuck,” and just sit with that.&nbsp;

**3\. Support.**&nbsp;Reach out to your people (or person) and tell them about your experience. Just get it off your chest. You don’t have to seek advice, but try seeking support and empathy from people who care about you. Empathy is a balm for the soul.

If you can remember one thing, remember this: Vulnerability is not weakness; it’s our greatest measure of courage. It’s a skill set that we can practice and get better at. If you want to possess that new land, you have to get through vulnerability.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about today’s topic or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.&nbsp;*Aloha*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*salamat po*.
