It’s February, the month we celebrate love, the Lunar New Year, and my birthday (yes, I’m 25 again). Birthdays, much like the new year, are times for reflection and renewal because we’re reminded of the brevity of time, what truly matters, and can see a bit clearer. **Here’s a secret:** I don’t just celebrate my birth*day*; I celebrate all month long. I love celebrating all month long because I’m more intentional about asking myself what I need to feel whole.&nbsp;

That simple question often inspires me to desire some sort of action that I would typically ignore. For example, one year I took up ballroom dancing and black and white photography. I wasn’t so great at the latter, but it was worth a try. In recent years, I started celebrating those closest to me and raising causes near and dear to my heart.&nbsp;

This year was a little different; I got a haircut and went to the dentist. Those are simple things but restorative nonetheless. We need things that remind us of our humanness and what we love. **That’s the real gift—being able to come home to myself**. When things are crazy, I need strategies to help myself feel grounded.&nbsp;

As a business owner, coach to many leaders, and busy mom, I hear one consistent message from everyone: “I’ve hit the pandemic wall, and I’m tired.” So he’s my invitation: Let’s all pretend it’s our birthday month, and ask ourselves that crucial question: **What do I need to feel whole?** See what arises, and give yourself permission to do and be. It’s that simple.&nbsp;

Whether that means spending a day at the beach, hiking or walking a trail, practicing your golf swing with a bucket of balls, cleaning out your closet, or something else, just do it with no apology. Remember: It doesn’t have to be your birthday to acknowledge your humanness and live your values. **When you take care of yourself, others will follow.**

If this message resonates with you, send me an email, and let me know that you’re taking care of yourself. If you know this is a message someone else needs to hear, please forward it to them. *Salamat po\!*
