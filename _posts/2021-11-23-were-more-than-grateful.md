Aloha Friends and Colleagues,

The 2021 holiday season has officially begun\! We hope you are as excited as we are.

**We’d like to take a moment to express our deepest gratitude to you this Thanksgiving.**&nbsp;Working alongside you, hearing your stories, or providing virtual support to help you stretch your learning and leadership edge has been a great honor.&nbsp;

“There’s no me without you”. Big thanks for daring to lead, getting curious, circling back when necessary and making choices to serve the work and not the ego.&nbsp; You make the difference\!

Please enjoy this season of Thanksgiving with great food, deep human connection, and a little pumpkin crunch on the side\! That’s what we plan to do\!

In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have a leadership question or an ah-ha that you’ve just got to share.&nbsp;

Team CaPeesh is happy to support.&nbsp;

Maligayang Pasasalamat (Happy Thanksgiving)\!
