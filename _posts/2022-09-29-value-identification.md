Have you ever taken the time to identify your values? I’m here to share a tool which I believe is the foundation for effective leadership and wholehearted living. It's called Value Identification, and you can access the guide by clicking here.&nbsp;

Value Identification is a process where you look at a list of values, identify your top 10, distill it down to your top five, and then eventually your top two. **The key is to not spend too much time obsessing over whether you're going to get it right or wrong.** I suggest that you follow your intuition, and circle the ones that you feel show up most frequently in your life.

Remember that values are not aspirations; they’re who you are and how you express yourself most often. Values are important to me because **they are the core of my decisions, and they tell me if I am headed in the right direction.** Then, once you've identified your top two values, I encourage you to share them with your circle of trust so your loved ones can help keep you accountable. This is a great family or team exercise.&nbsp;

Go ahead and give it a try, and send me a note to let me know how it's working for you. If you have questions, I'm happy to help—just call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you\!
