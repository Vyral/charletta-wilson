When it comes to business, people and disruption, there is never a shortage of needs for leadership development. &nbsp;

However, in the sea of opportunities, where does one start? &nbsp;

I suggest an initial conversation **assessing current conditions**. &nbsp;

* What’s driving **change** in our business now and what are the long-term **issues** we face?&nbsp;
* Who are **now** vs. who do we want **to be** in the face of change?
* What **performance** **improvement** needs can address these changes/issues?
* What known/unknown **barriers** stand in the way of moving forward?&nbsp;

Based on your findings, you can work with a professional coach (distinct from a consultant or advisor) to identify blind spots, initial and subsequent strategies.&nbsp; While there is no single best solution, these **three leadership development areas** address both the individual as well as the system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1\. Infuse courage into your culture.&nbsp;**

With the pace of change, it takes courage skills to move away from status quo and into new territory.&nbsp; It is not enough to say, “we want change in our business” without changing the people.&nbsp; Systemic change generally means…yes…you too\!&nbsp; Just like a stuck relationship, a business will only change when mindsets shift, actions with accountability are taken and attitudes of possibilities are awakened.&nbsp; We always start from the top.

**2\. Build bench strength. &nbsp;**

Growing leaders from ‘within’ a system and ‘within’ one’s self is a smart and efficient way of filling critical gaps and minimizing momentum losses when the business game changes.&nbsp; Stretch assignments, mentoring, peer-exchange, cross-functional teaming are just a few ways to keep business going as leaders move up or out of the organization.&nbsp; A weak bench leads to perpetual problems.

**3\. Make room for mistakes.**

The gift of coaching many leaders from different backgrounds is identifying themes.&nbsp; One trend I’ve observed is leaders putting too much emphasis on wanting to be seen as “the expert”.&nbsp; Let me just dispel this myth – EVEN IF YOU ARE THE EXPERT, JOBS ARE NEVER SAFE.&nbsp; What we are needing in this incredible time of disruption and innovation are leaders who are empowered to take risks.&nbsp; Through coaching, many leaders discover that mistakes are an integral part of growth and innovation.&nbsp; My favorite story that demonstrates the power of mistakes is owned by [3M Post-It notes.](https://www.post-it.com/3M/en_US/post-it/contact-us/about-us/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;&nbsp;

Finally, as you explore leadership development for your team and business be clear in defining what it means to your organization at different stages.&nbsp; Your coach can help guide your steps in operationalizing leadership development, and crafting an action-based strategy that helps you improve awareness, vision and decision-making; while learning new skills to overcome challenges and setbacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
